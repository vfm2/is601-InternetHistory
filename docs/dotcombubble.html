        <h4>Amazon</h4>
        <p>
            In the 1990s, Amazon and eBay were launched on the Internet, helping introduce the revolution of e-commerce.
            Jeff Bezos first launched Amazon in 1995.
            When thinking about the web and business, he made a list of products that would be ideal to sell with books
            being at the top of each list. From his perspective, books were the number one thing that would be worth
            selling online. Within months of Amazon’s launch, Amazon was shipping books to 45 countries and all 50 of
            the United States. Amazon found their business was growing greatly. Bezos even claimed it to be Earth’s
            Biggest Bookstore.

        <h4>eBay</h4>
        <p>
            That same year, Pierre Omidyar was a software engineer who had the idea of an online auction site that
            would eventually become eBay. He set out to create a more fair and efficient marketplace where the playing
            field was even among all consumers. Anyone could auction off anything they desired online and anyone could
            also bid on those same products. Soon after eBay was launched online, the company was earning thousands of
            dollars in fees.

<h4 style="margin: 25px">Success of the Internet: Moore's Law and Metcalfe's Law</h4>
<p style="margin: 25px">
    Essentially, the Internet became even more successful and there were more users than ever. Amazon and eBay were
    also very successful companies. Overall it only took the Internet 4 years for there to be over 50 million users.
    Part of this is in thanks to Moore’s Law and the silicon chip. Moore’s Law is a statement that claims that the
    speed and power of integrated circuits will double every 18 months, aka growing exponentially over time.
    Transistors became smaller and smaller and allowed for faster and more efficient technology. Once Moore’s Law was
    seen to be true, it continued to hold true over the years. Additionally, Metcalfe’s Law also came into play. What
    Metcalfe’s Law is saying is that the number of users is proportional to the number of connections in the system.
    The more user there are, the larger the network becomes. And the larger the network becomes, the more powerful and
    useful it can be.
