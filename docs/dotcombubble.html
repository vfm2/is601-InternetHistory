            In the 1990s, Amazon and eBay were launched on the Internet, helping introduce the revolution of e-commerce.
            Jeff Bezos first launched Amazon in 1995.
            When thinking about the web and business, he made a list of products that would be ideal to sell with books
            being at the top of each list. From his perspective, books were the number one thing that would be worth
            selling online. Within months of Amazon’s launch, Amazon was shipping books to 45 countries and all 50 of
            the United States. Amazon found their business was growing greatly. Bezos even claimed it to be Earth’s
            Biggest Bookstore.

            That same year, Pierre Omidyar was a software engineer who had the idea of an online auction site that
            would eventually become eBay. He set out to create a more fair and efficient marketplace where the playing
            field was even among all consumers. Anyone could auction off anything they desired online and anyone could
            also bid on those same products. Soon after eBay was launched online, the company was earning thousands of
            dollars in fees. What became surprisingly popular on the site was the auctioning of collectibles,
            and even specifically beanie babies.

<h4 style="margin: 25px">Success of the Internet: Moore's Law and Metcalfe's Law</h4>
<p style="margin: 25px">
    Essentially, the Internet became even more successful and there were more users than ever. Amazon and eBay were
    also very successful companies. Overall it only took the Internet 4 years for there to be over 50 million users.
    Part of this is in thanks to Moore’s Law and the silicon chip. Moore’s Law is a statement that claims that the
    speed and power of integrated circuits will double every 18 months, aka growing exponentially over time.
    Transistors became smaller and smaller and allowed for faster and more efficient technology. Once Moore’s Law was
    seen to be true, it continued to hold true over the years. Additionally, Metcalfe’s Law also came into play. What
    Metcalfe’s Law is saying is that the number of users is proportional to the number of connections in the system.
    The more user there are, the larger the network becomes. And the larger the network becomes, the more powerful and
    useful it can be.

                    When it comes to online commerce, there are also big implications for security.
                    Therefore, encryption and public-key cryptography were created. Encryption is the process of encoding information
                    such as credit card numbers or addresses in online transactions. Public-key cryptography on the other hand is a
                    form of encryption that uses public keys and private keys. Public keys are generally available to anyone to encrypt
                    certain data but must be decrypted by a private key. Similarly, private keys can encrypt some data, but then it
                    must be decrypted by a public key. This helps prevent any data or information from being hacked by anyone who
                    shouldn’t have access to data other than those whom it was intended to.

                When Amazon and eBay had their IPOs (initial public offerings) in the late 1990s, this started the mania
                that is the Dot Com Bubble. Any company with a “dot com” in its company name or was otherwise known as an
                online company boomed in the stock market. Many shares were bought these companies made much money from it.
                E-commerce was taking off and the 90s was becoming the e-decade. By 1999, there were 250 Internet IPOs.
                However, in 2000 on Black Friday the NASDAQ index fell by more than 25% and later on with the September 11
                attacks on the Twin Towers, that number continued to drop. Many Internet companies had to shut down and other
                big companies that did survive still hurt from the burst of the Dot Com Bubble.

<h4 style="margin:25px">The Bubble Bursts</h4>
    <p style="margin: 25px">
        After the burst of the Dot Com Bubble, Wall Street was felt to blame. The Attorney General of New York at
        the time set to reform the IPO industry. Henry Blodgett, a former Wall Street analyst, was charged with civil
        securities fraud based on critical emails about how he figured not many Internet companies would survive for
        long and would suffer from a stock market crash. Because he knew that the Dot Com Bubble was a speculative
        bubble that would eventually pop, he ended up being banned from the securities industry for life.
