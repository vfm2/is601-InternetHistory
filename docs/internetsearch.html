        <h3>Paving the way</h3>
        <p>Before Google enhanced the browser experience, search engines like Yahoo and Excite paved the way for users to have an easier 
            time to look through the web.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm">
                <!--Yahoo -->
                <div class="text-center">
                    <image src="image/yahoo.png" class="img-fluid">
                </div>
                <p>Yahoo was created by two Stanford students majoring in mechanical engineering, Jerry Yang and David Filo. Their main goal was to
                    create a website to efficiently search for their own fantasy basketball team. That vision grew as they compiled more and more links to pages onto one 
                    directory. Their design for Yahoo was to have a guide or directory full of categories and subcategories so users could easily browse through the web. 
                    Their idea took off as millions of users from around the world came to the site, 
                    but they were unsure how to profit off their new search engine.</p>
                
                <p>Michael Moritz, Venture Capitalist and partner at Sequoia Capital, invested in the company and made a huge impact on their business model. 
                    At that time, advertising on the web was unheard of. Debates and conversations over the morality of commercializing the web took place in South Park, CA. 
                    Because of this, the founders of Yahoo had a difficult time agreeing to introduce ad banners to the website. 
                    Their fear was users would find it unappealing and leave Yahoo.</p>

                <p>After discussion, Yang and Filo agreed to the banners and put their first one up in 1995. To their relief, the amount of users kept multiplying, proving for the 
                    first time the internet could make money. Afterward, the web boom had started!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm">
                <!--Excite-->
                <div class="text-center">
                    <image src="image/excite.png" class="img-fluid">
                </div>
                <p>As time went on, more competitors emerged and impacted the search engine world incredibly. Excite was one of Yahoo's top competitors. 
                    Founder Joe Kraus had a different idea for Excite’s creation. Rather than Yahoo’s method of manually compiling links, Excite used software to query links of the searched term. 
                    Excite might have started at the bottom of the search engine popularity, 
                    but that quickly changed and became Yahoo’s main competitor as they each fought to be the best search engine.</p>

                <p>Yahoo and Excite became more than just a search engine. It was a place for users to send emails, personalize your account, and much more. As the companies enhanced the features on their 
                    search engine, they lost track of the original goal; for users to search the web.</p>

    <div class="container">
        <!--Google-->
        <h3 class="text-center">Google</h3>
        <br>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col col-lg-7 ">
                <p>Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin recognized the weaknesses of the current search engines and found a way to improve the “search” feature. Their idea stemmed through the theory that 
                    the websites were a ‘popularity contest’. Users wanted to see sites that had the most views. They came up with link counting. The most visited links would be listed at the top of the search engine 
                    making it easier for users to find websites they intended to find.</p>

                <p>First starting off, Page and Brin had a hard time finding investors for their search engine. They met with different companies including Excite, but were turned down. 
                    It was not until David Cheriton, their professor at Stanford, was able to finally help them out. Cheriton introduced Page and Brin to the first angel doner, Andy Bechtolsheim, 
                    who immediately wrote a check for $100,000. 
                    Bechtolsheim was the first of many doners to make Google possible. </p>

                <p>The Google founders met with other investors and were given 12 million dollars by people such as John Doerr, because they predicted such as high as 10 billion in revenue. 
                    The money given allowed Google to create a search engine that was user-friendly, organized, and universally accessible. Banner ads were out of the question, along with commercializing 
                    their home page to keep the simplicity of the site appealing to users. Due to this, the new struggle they faced was figuring out their business model on how to show their ads. Luckily, 
                    they found Bill Gross, founder of a small company called Idealabs</p>

                <p>Bill Gross figured out users searched for items they were interested in buying. He believed search engines could be the greatest marking tool. The key words users searched is a window 
                    into what the user might want to buy at that moment. The theory was similar to Yellow Page. Page and Brin took that idea and applied it to Google. When a user searched for an item, the 
                    left side would be ‘organic’ links of top website, 
                    while the right side of google would be advertisements.</p>

                <p>Google went public on August 19, 2004 on the Nasdaq sales market. It went from zero profit to three billion dollars annually in a five year time span making it one of the fastest growing company. 
                    Google is a top tech company and is constantly improving. The Google campus is full of free food, games, bean bag chairs, to make it a fun and friendly environment to the employees. </p>

                <p>Search engines Yahoo, Excite, and Google impacted how we gather information. Their influence on world wide web allowed users to view the content needed and are heavily used to this day!</p>
