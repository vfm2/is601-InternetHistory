    The invention of the Internet has had an impact on society like no other. Today the Internet is such a huge part
    of our lives that it seems nearly impossible to imagine what it would be like without it. It provides a space where
    people can do business and shop, watch user-generated content and access TV and movies online, listen to music,
    search and find information, and develop relationships, and communicate with other people regardless of distance.
</p>
<p style="margin: 25px">
    How the Internet came to be dates back to the 1950s. Dr. JCR Licklider, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
    Technology, was a psychologist who envisioned if computers were connected to better communicate with each other and
    allow for easier sharing of information. The very first computers were expensive and large unlike the laptops many
    people carry around today. Back then they weren't very common to have and weren't easy to use either.

    Amidst the space race with Russia in the 1960s, the US government created ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency), which funded research dedicated to the
    space race. At the time, it also included computer science. However, NASA was also created, which is where any
    space-related research was relocated to, leaving ARPA and computer science. People turned their attention more to NASA
    as opposed to ARPA with the ongoing space race as America worked on getting the first man to the moon and back.

    Then, a graduate student named Leonard Kleinrock realized data transmission queueing theory would be able to work in terms
    of computers and communication. He showed how packets of data would line up in a queue and then one at a time be transmitted
    through the network. Along those same lines, Licklider's vision of computer communication began to come to fruition with
    circuit switching. Circuit switching is a method in which two nodes (or systems) are connected in a network. Once those two
    nodes are connected, they are able to communicate data back and forth. This was great for the development of computer systems
    but its one disadvantage was risking security and safety if the path broke at any time. This was particularly important
    during the Cold War in the 1960s when the US military feared nuclear attacks from the Soviet Union. Hence, a more durable and
    secure communications network was needed.

    Paul Baran was hired to see if he could build fishnet type networks. While developing his ideas, Baran was inspired
    by a study conducted on mice. There was a machine in this student that modeled how the mouse made its way through a
    maze. If this was true for mice, then the same must be true for information. Then from the invention of the Telegraph,
    Baran decided to "chop up" messages into equally small pieces called packets. These packets of information would then
    move along different routes through the network to its designated recipient. This became known as packet switching networks.

    In 1966, Bob Taylor, a part of ARPA was doing some time sharing on a terminal. Time sharing was where several users were
    using the same computer operating system simultaneously. Taylor needed to be logged into several time shared computers
    at various research centers and found he needed to move from terminal to terminal constantly to obtain the information
    he needed. Because of this frustration, Taylor wanted to find a way to connect these machines as at the time, none of
    these computers were connected. Taylor wanted to link heterogeneous computers in the same network so that all machines
    could communicate with one another. He thought it could save time, effort, and resources. With $1 million in funding,
    Taylor recruited Larry Robers to help him build and develop his ideas. At MIT, Roberts built the world's first experimental
    connection between two computers. Roberts initially wasn't sure how to connect mainframe computers, but
    then was inspired by fellow engineers to essentially create "mini computers." Those mini computers would be connected
    to each other, and each was also connected to one mainframe computer. Therefore, the mainframe computer would only have to be connected
    to one mini computer. All the mini computers would be easily connected because they were the same and could transmit
    data and information through each other. Roberts came up with the concept but needed someone to help build it.
