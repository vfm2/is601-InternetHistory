            The invention of the Internet has had an impact on society like no other. Today the Internet is such a huge part
            of our lives that it seems nearly impossible to imagine what it would be like without it. It provides a space where
            people can do business and shop, watch user-generated content and access TV and movies online, listen to music,
            search and find information, and develop relationships, and communicate with other people regardless of distance.
            </p>
            <p style="margin: 25px">
            How the Internet came to be dates back to the 1950s. Dr. JCR Licklider, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
            Technology, was a psychologist who envisioned if computers were connected to better communicate with each other and
            allow for easier sharing of information. The very first computers were expensive and large unlike the laptops many
            people carry around today. Back then they weren't very common to have and weren't easy to use either.

            Amidst the space race with Russia in the 1960s, the US government created ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency), which funded research dedicated to the
            space race. At the time, it also included computer science. However, NASA was also created, which is where any
            space-related research was relocated to, leaving ARPA and computer science. People turned their attention more to NASA
            as opposed to ARPA with the ongoing space race as America worked on getting the first man to the moon and back.

    Then, a graduate student named Leonard Kleinrock realized data transmission queueing theory would be able to work in terms
    of computers and communication. He showed how packets of data would line up in a queue and then one at a time be transmitted
    through the network. Along those same lines, Licklider's vision of computer communication began to come to fruition with
    circuit switching. Circuit switching is a method in which two nodes (or systems) are connected in a network. Once those two
    nodes are connected, they are able to communicate data back and forth. This was great for the development of computer systems
    but its one disadvantage was risking security and safety if the path broke at any time. This was particularly important
    during the Cold War in the 1960s when the US military feared nuclear attacks from the Soviet Union. Hence, a more durable and
    secure communications network was needed.

    Paul Baran was hired to see if he could build fishnet type networks. While developing his ideas, Baran was inspired
    by a study conducted on mice. There was a machine in this student that modeled how the mouse made its way through a
    maze. If this was true for mice, then the same must be true for information. Then from the invention of the Telegraph,
    Baran decided to "chop up" messages into equally small pieces called packets. These packets of information would then
    move along different routes through the network to its designated recipient. This became known as packet switching networks.

    In 1966, Bob Taylor, a part of ARPA was doing some time sharing on a terminal. Time sharing was where several users were
    using the same computer operating system simultaneously. Taylor needed to be logged into several time shared computers
    at various research centers and found he needed to move from terminal to terminal constantly to obtain the information
    he needed. Because of this frustration, Taylor wanted to find a way to connect these machines as at the time, none of
    these computers were connected. Taylor wanted to link heterogeneous computers in the same network so that all machines
    could communicate with one another. He thought it could save time, effort, and resources. With $1 million in funding,
    Taylor recruited Larry Roberts to help him build and develop his ideas. At MIT, Roberts built the world's first experimental
    connection between two computers. Roberts initially wasn't sure how to connect mainframe computers, but
    then was inspired by fellow engineers to essentially create "mini computers." Those mini computers would be connected
    to each other, and each was also connected to one mainframe computer. Therefore, the mainframe computer would only have to be connected
    to one mini computer. All the mini computers would be easily connected because they were the same and could transmit
    data and information through each other. Roberts came up with the concept but needed someone to help build it. He sought
    out the engineers at ARPA.

    With the engineers at ARPA, the ARPANET would be built, aka the ARPA network. This network would be based on interface
    message processors (IMPS) and packet switching technology. There would be four IMPs connected together, and each of those
    four IMPs would be connected to a different mainframe computer in different locations. As the project progressed along, Roberts
    asked big communications and tech companies to invest in this project such as IBM and AT&T. However, thinking this
    wouldn't be successful, they refused. A company called BBN Technologies in Cambridge did take up this opportunity
    to help build the ARPANET. During the development of the IMPs, several obstacles occurred. One of these had to do
    with having to rush the development and construction, but others were technical problems that were unseen before. That
    included how packets would know to stop circulating in the network, what would happen if the network was overflowed
    by a big message, and the possibility of the mainframe computers not being capable of these ideas and technology.

            Despite the obstacles, at the end of 1969, all 4 IMPs were connected and were able to transmit data and information
            through the network successfully. By 1971, there were 18 networks connected. One of these networks was connected to
            the MIT computer by Robert Metcalfe. Now that the ARPANET was working, files could be sent back and forth in the network
            between all the members using the mainframe computers. That was all it could do, however, until the idea of mail came up.
            Raymond Tomlinson wrote the program for e-mails and made better use of the '@' symbol. This truly revolutionized
            communication among people. As we know, e-mails are still an important aspect of computers today.

            From there, the amount of networks began to steadily increase. Local area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs)
            were developed to link computers in buildings or campuses together. Because of this huge increase in networks, Vint
            Cerf and Bob Khan developed the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) as a set of rules and procedures for people using
            the network to send information and data to and fro. In 1983, TCP/IP was adopted as the standard in developing the Internet
            and hold the interconnected network of networks.

            As the Internet developed more functionality
            and became more user-friendly with the invention of the mouse, silicon chip, modem, etc., the government decided
            to step out of regulating it. In 1992, Congress signed a bill that unleashed the Internet to the public for people to
            commercially use for whatever purposes they wanted. As a result, more individuals could use the Internet freely.
            However, there was one issue with it among the public, which was that the Internet was difficult to use. It was like
            being in the Library of Congress: having all the information one could ever want, but being unsure of how and where
            to best access the information one needed. One needed to be well acquainted with computers to be able to easily
            use the Internet.

            To Tim Berners-Lee, the Internet looked to him like a web, which led him to invent the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee
            developed software to be able to much more easily follow threads of information across the Internet. With the computer
            mouse, one could click on a link or a word and be transported to another page with more information. Information and
            data became more linked together and were easier to search and find. It still wasn't the most user-friendly to use
            with the average citizen, but it still set up the table for what would be the first web browser. Before then, there were
            only about 50 websites total on the Internet.

        Netscape had developed Mosaic, the first web browser. Mosaic is one of the first web browsers to exist, and won't be the
        most popular or last to exist, but the Internet and World Wide Web usage grew tremendously. It became even easier to search
        for information on the Internet and better allowed for the average person to do so.

        By the end of the 20th century, the computer had gone from this large, expensive, and difficult-to-use machine to a
        revolutionary technology that anyone could use easily. The Internet was something that anyone could access for whatever commercial
        reason, whether that be gaming, shopping, researching, connections with people, etc. The Internet is indefinitely
        under construction as it continues to improve every day, and surely the people who had invented the computer, the Internet,
        and the World Wide Web had no idea how much of an impact their inventions changed the world.
