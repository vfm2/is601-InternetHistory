            <h3>Background on the People</h3>
            <p>The key players in the Browser wars were Marc Andreessen, James H. Clark (Jim), Bill Gates, 
                Thomad Rearden and Gary Reback. Andreessen was the creator of the first graphical web browser called Mosaic. 
                He was a computer science major at the University of Illinois who thought the internet should be used for 
                everyday people, not just for scientists and researchers. He worked with many university students to finish 
                up Mosaic. Former computer science professor at Stanford University, Jim founded a company called Silicon Graphics. 
                After leaving Silicon graphics, he became a major investor of Mosaic and co-founder of Netscape. 
                He Reached out to Marc Andreessen to create a team of undergrad students, including engineers Aleks Totic, 
                Lou Montulli and Rob McCool;  to work for Netscape Company. Bill Gates is the co-founder and CEO of Microsoft. 
                Gates and his partner Paul Alen started working on Microsoft in 1975. He envisioned having a PC in every household, 
                along with his software installed on each computer. Known for ruining other competitors and being harsh to employees.
                Thomas Rearden, an engineer at Microsoft, represented Microsoft in the Microsoft and Netscape meeting. 
                Reached out to Netscape on behalf of Microsoft multiple times. Gary Reback was the lawyer for Netscape 
                that filed an Antitrust Lawsuit against Microsoft.

                <h3 class="text-center">The Browser Battle</h3>
                <p>Netscape was released on October, 13th 1994 and became an immediate success by hitting one million downloads. 
                    This got the attention of Bill Gates. Microsoft did not want the competition so they could have control over the internet. 
                    Whoever owns the platform, owns the power! Bill Gates recognized the threat of Netscape becoming the main platform in the 
                    software industry and started off the browser war. Microsoft got in touch with Netscape to set up a meeting which lasted 
                    six hours. According to Microsoft, it was a great meeting. It was very relaxed as they discussed how Netscape could work 
                    with Microsoft applications such as word, excel, etc. Netscape, on the other hand, had a very different view of how the 
                    meeting went. The Netscape team said Microsoft wanted to either buy Netscape for a one time purchase of one million dollars, 
                    which would give access to all of their technology. If they didn’t comply, Microsoft would still mimic all of their technology. 
                    After this meeting, Netscape immediately contacted their lawyer, Gary Reback, to file a lawsuit. 
                    Reback alerted the US Justice Department to start the groundwork for an antitrust lawsuit.</p>

                <h3 class="text-center">The Wins and the Losses</h3>
                <p>Only after a year Netscape was released, they decided to go public. Their new IPO was a huge success and became one of the biggest IPOs in history.
                    Microsoft decided to release their own web browser called Internet Explorer. Their employees worked 24/7 to get the browser deployed. When it was released, 
                    Microsoft made deals with PC to stop installing Netscape on their machines. They threated to cancel their Windows license if Netscape or other software were installed. Due to this agreement and 
                    Microsoft giving their browser away for free, Internet Explorer grew to 80% of users using IE instead of Netscape. Netscape was over.

            <h3>The End</h3>
            <p>Although Netscape lost the browser wars, Microsoft did not necessarily win long term. 
                Due to the lawsuit Netscape had against Microsoft, the US government thought of them as high-tech terrorists. 
                As interviews went on with Bill Gates, Gates was caught in many lies while defending his company. He even lied 
                about an email that was sent out saying his plans for Netscape, even though he said “Netscape was not on his radar”. 
                Gates was found guilty and their stock paid the price as it went down 30 million dollars, and Gates had to split the company into two. 
                The verdict was later rescinded, but Bill Gates stepped down from the company to focus on charity work around the world.
                <br>
                Internet Explorer won the browser wars, but in the long term it hurt their company. 
                Microsoft was known for their monopoly, harshness and cutthroat nature of the company.
