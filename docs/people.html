            Once the 2000s hit, the Internet began to be revolutionized by the society who used it as opposed to the
            Internet revolutionizing society. Websites such as Napster, YouTube, Facebook, and MySpace made a great impact
            on how people interacted with each other online, publish their own content, or download othersâ€™ content.

<h4 style="margin: 25px">Beginnings of Music and the Internet</h4>
    <p style="margin: 25px">
        Today one of the great things about technology is the ability to play music anytime and anywhere. Whether that's
        on Spotify or Apple Music or YouTube, as long as you had a wifi connection or downloaded music, you can listen
        to music whenever you want. But back in the earlier days of the Internet, listening or downloading music from
        the Internet seemed like a fantasy. Some computers didn't even have speakers yet. However, mp3 files started
        to come into use as it was a way to compress data and make it easier to get music from online websites. Then,
        Winamp and Audion came into play. They were applications where users could download mp3 files to their computers
        to listen to. This greatly changed how people obtained music where beforehand you would have to purchase CDs,
        cassette tapes, or records.

<h4 style="text-center; margin: 25px">Controversy with Napster</h4>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-2">
                <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/55915377e4b05e44b9c13bca/1535515150211-O2O5767XRDJRF1WG2A1Q/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kBWyD8QCmC-NZpLkl_N5vSFZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PI9aFTLD3JG2DfIRHeuIRpa4xu4_TgvxFcnMk4xTGxEDc/Napster-Logo-.png" style="max-width: 200px">

                Napster was a website founded by Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker. When they were in college at Northeastern University,
                they programmed a way for mp3 files to be exchanged among people and download it into your computer. Once it was
                released among a few people, more and more people got a hold of it and it unleashed the phenomenon of downloading
                music from online. It was primarily used by college students across the US. Using Napster meant free music. As
                it became more successful, Fanning and Parker made it an official business out in Silicon Valley.

        However, the controversy lies with complications of copyright infringement and threats of intellectual property.
        To record labels and artists, this was considered illegal activity because no one was paying for the music. If a
        song was copyrighted, it was considered illegal to download and listen to it. Artists like rapper, Dr. Dre, and
        heavy metal band, Metallica, eventually heard about Napster and what this meant for their music, their sales,
        and the music business. Essentially, they were not happy with it.
    </p>
    <p style="margin: 25px">
        The controversy was eventually taken to court in 2001 and Napster had to be shut down immediately. This angered some
        people who used Napster previously and no longer could, of course. However, it did set the table for other companies
        to begin allowing music to be downloaded online but at a cost. One of the first examples is Apple releasing
        the iTunes store where songs could be purchased for 99 cents each. This enabled artists and record labels to still
        earn money from their music while users could have music on their computer.

<h4 style="text-center; margin: 25px">YouTube Facebook, and Web 2.0</h4>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <img src="image/socialmediaapps.jpg" style="max-height: 300px">
            </div>

                <p style="margin: 25px">
                After what happened with Napster came the rise of YouTube in 2005-2006. YouTube's platform intention was for it to be a place
                where people could "broadcast" themselves and provide and view other people's entertainment. YouTube had similar copyright
                issues like Napster where people were uploading content such as movies, music, and television programs, however. But
                YouTube, as we know, wasn't shut down or anywhere near it. This was because YouTube was owned by Google, a big tech
                company at that point. YouTube took down any copyrighted content they could detect but it was still difficult to do
                at the end of the day. Still, online videos became a big way for people to communicate their lives and interests with others.
                As we all know, being a YouTuber is even considered a career and is a big part of our online world today. Other companies
                also took note and allowed users to post online video content as well. This included Craigslist, Flickr, match.com, and
                Digg. This eventually turned into something that would be called Web 2.0: the experience of being able to contribute
                to the internet as well as gain things from it.

                <p  style="margin: 25px">
                A large part of Web 2.0 was the development of social media. This included MySpace and Facebook, two of the first big
                social media platforms. MySpace quickly garnered many users online and was a way for people to connect online and learn
                about others' music interests, daily happenings, and overall gave insight into who people were. As for Facebook,
                founded by Mark Zuckerberg, it was a social network started at Harvard for college students that expanded to all colleges,
                all high schools, and to everyone. Similar to MySpace, it was a place for people to be more open and connected. As social
                media platforms became more prominent in people's lives, other tech startups popped up and made impacts as well. Web 2.0
                became a place not only for people to find information, but to contribute information, do business, communicate with
                each other, create their own content, and enjoy entertainment at home.
